abstract = "With the further development of deregulated electricity market in many other countries around the world, a lot of challenges have been identified for market data management, network topology processing and fast market-clearance mechanism design. In this paper, a graph computing framework based on TigerGraph database is proposed to solve a security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) problem, with parallelized graph power flow (PGPF) and innovative LU decomposition techniques, for electricity market-clearance. It also provides a comprehensive visualization platform to demonstrate the market clearing results vividly, such as locational marginal price (LMP), and is able to be utilized for electricity market operators' education and training purpose."
