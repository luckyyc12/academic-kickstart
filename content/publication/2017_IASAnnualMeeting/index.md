abstract = "Multiphase induction machine offers many advantages over the conventional three-phase machine, like lower harmonics, reduced torque pulsation amplitude while increasing its frequency, decreased phase current, and cutting down power loss. It is particularly useful in the emerging heavy-duty and off-road vehicle applications. In this paper, a control strategy for multifunction nine-phase induction machine is proposed to increase the maximum speed without sacrificing the maximum torque. Another advantage of this machine drive system is lower voltage and current requirements. With electric pole change, the induction machine can reduce mutual inductance at high speeds. Due to lower mutual inductance, the back EMF is lower and a large dc-link voltage is not necessary at high speeds. This helps in lowering the dc-dc power conversion requirements. Moreover, the conduction loss is also reduced with the decrease in phase current, thereby cutting the costs of cooling. The proposed park inverse transformation is elaborated for multiphase condition. Simulation results from MATLAB/Simulink are displayed first to illustrate the effectiveness of control strategy. The proposed nine-phase induction machine was tested on a Caterpillar off road vehicle and the brief performance evaluation of the system-level benefits is also presented in this paper."
